What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. It focuses on enabling computers to understand and interpret human language. In simple terms, NLP helps machines "read" and "understand" what we speak or write.

For example: When you use a chatbot, speak to Siri, or type a query in Google Search â€” NLP is working in the background!

NLP involves many tasks: Tokenization, Part-of-Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Machine Translation, and more.

Why do we clean text before applying NLP?

We need to convert all text into lowercase, remove punctuation marks like commas, periods, and quotes. We also remove stopwords such as "is", "a", "the", "and", "in", "of", "on", etc.

Cleaning helps in reducing noise and making the core content more meaningful for the algorithm to learn.
